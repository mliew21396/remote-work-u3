# U3.W8: Conflict

## Learning Competencies
- Describe how you dealt with a conflict
- Evaluate whether your actions produced positive or negative reactions

## Release 0: New file
In your [USERNAME].github.io/blog directory, copy your blog template into a new HTML file named `c8-conflict.html`.

## Release 1: Identify sources of conflict
We have all faced conflict in our lives, some of them minor, like arguing about where to go to dinner, and some far more major, like arguing with a family member about a big decision.

It's easy to identify "anger" or "upset" as an emotion you feel when you are facing conflict, but these are overly general, catch-all emotions that hide more specific emotions.

Here is an example, a woman student at DBC::SF came in every morning to a dirty space. Dishes were piled in the sink, glasses were all over the space, and the counters were wet in places or had crumbs in others. Besides being an issue of general hygiene, this woman also felt the actions of the people in the space were disrespectful of others, so she spent about 45 minutes every morning cleaning the kitchen and washing dishes. Each day, she hoped a good example would be set and people would keep the space clean if it started that way. Eventually, she realized that didn't work and became angry with unknown people. Upon analyzing the situation and trying to break it down to its most basic level, she realized the reason she was having this conflict was because she felt her time and worth as a person was being disrespected by others. She guessed others left their dishes in the sink because they "didn't have time" because they were so busy coding. This made her feel like they did not respect her time or value as a programmer. Instead of feeling angered by the situation, she was able to pin-point the emotions that were at the root of her anger and come up with a method for not feeling it (which was to stop cleaning up after others).

When feeling angry, it's valuable to break down your anger into the most basic parts. It helps people talk about the conflict in a more open, honest, and specific way. For example, instead of saying "I'm angry people don't clean up," the woman above could say, "I feel disrespected by others who do not do their dishes because I feel they don't value my time or value." This gives the offenders some understanding of why someone is upset, and is less likely to make them defensive. They also may look at their own actions in a new way.

In many ways, analyzing a conflict is the same as analyzing a coding problem. You look at the larger problem or effect of a situation, and you want to break that down into its most basic elements. In this blog post, you will practice doing that for a conflict.

It's important to note that while you may feel tempted to consider the most emotional conflict you've had, it's not necessary. This exercise will work on any conflict, large or small. Talking about conflict is also a pretty standard interview question, so this is a chance at preparing for those types of questions.

## Release 2: Blog

Once you've created your file, write a blog post that responds to each question.

1. Discuss a time you had a conflict. What was it about? What happened?
2. What was the source of the conflict?
3. What basic emotions did you feel upon analyzing the conflict?
4. What actions did you take to resolve your conflict?
5. If you could go back, what would you do differently, if anything?
6. What did you learn from this experience?

## Release 3: Publish
