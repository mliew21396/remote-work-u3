# U3.W8: Dealing with Conflict

## Learning Competencies
- Describe how you dealt with a conflict
- Evaluate whether your actions produced positive or negative reactions

## Release 0: New file
In your [USERNAME].github.io/blog directory, copy your blog template into a new HTML file named `c8-conflict.html`.

## Release 1: Research Compass of Shame
Have you ever seen the [compass of shame](http://southdown.on.ca/publications/articles/Compass-of-Shame.pdf)? When people face a conflict, they will often use one of these strategies for dealing with shame.

Conduct some research on strategies for identifying the sources for conflict then discuss a time you had a conflict in your life. Identify the reason you had the conflict and whether your actions made it better or worse. You don't have to pick the most intense emotional conflict, choose one you feel OK sharing with others.

## Release 2: Blog

Once you've created your file, write a blog post that responds to each question.

1. Discuss a time you had an emotional conflict with someone. What was it about? What happened?
2. What was the source of the conflict?
3. How did you handle that conflict?
4. Did your actions make the conflict better or worse?
5. If you could go back, what would you do differently, if anything?
6. What did you learn from this experience?
