# U3.W8: Dealing with Conflict

## Learning Competencies
- Describe how you dealt with conflict
- Evaluate whether your actions produced positive or negative reactions

## Release 0: New file

First, create a new HTML file named `week8_cultural_blog.html` in your [USERNAME].github.io website in the blog-posts directory. Copy the Code from your `blog_template`.

## Release 1: Research Compass of Shame
Remember the [compass of shame](http://southdown.on.ca/publications/articles/Compass-of-Shame.pdf)? Oftentimes when we have a conflict with someone we use one of our strategies for dealing with shame.

Conduct some research on strategies for identifying the sources for conflict then discuss a time you had a conflict in your life. Identify the reason you had the conflict and whether your actions made it better or worse. You don't have to pick the most intense emotional conflict, choose one you are ok sharing with others.

## Release 2: Blog

Once you've opened your file, write a response to each exercise using the HTML you've learned to set up the file:

1. Discuss a time you had an emotional conflict with someone. What was it about? What happened?
2. What was the source of the conflict?
3. How did you handle that conflict?
4. Did your actions make the conflict better or worse?
5. If you could go back, what would you do differently, if anything?
6. What did you learn from this experience?

## Release 3: Publish
Link to your blog on the index of your site and push your changes.

Make sure the index of your site is maintained, nice, and professional. This is your face in the online community, so make it nice!

## Release 4: Promote

Now it's time to show off your work and share your knowledge with your cohortmates using Twitter!

Tweet your blog post using #DBCConflict

## Release 5: Read

Read at least one post another student wrote. Give the author A.S.K (Actionable, specific, and kind) feedback as an issue on their repo or a tweet!
