## Release 4: SQL Queries

Paste the correct SQL queries for each of the following challenges below. There is a screen shot associated with each challenge. You should make sure your query matches the screen shot before moving on.

1. Select all data for all states
  ![select states](1-select-states)

  SQL Query:

2. Select all data for the regions
  ![select regions](2-regions)

  SQL Query:

3. Select the `state_name` and `population` for all states.
  ![names population](3-names-population)

  SQL Query:

4. Select the `state_name` and `population` for all states ordered by population. The most populous state should be at the top.
  ![ordered by population](4-ordered-by-pop)

  SQL Query:

5. Select the 'state_name's for the states in region 7.
  ![region 7](5-states-region-7)

  SQL Query:

6. Select the 'state_names' and 'population_density' with a population density over 50 ordered from least to most dense.
  ![population density](6-population-density)

  SQL Query:

7. Select all state_names for states with a population between 1 million and 1.5 million people.
  ![population between](7-population-between)

  SQL Query:

8. Select all state_names and region_id ordered by region in ascending order.
  ![by region id](8-by-region-id)

  SQL Query:

9. Select the 'region_name' for the regions with "Central" in the name.
  ![central regions](9-regions-central)

  SQL Query:

10. Select all of the region names and the state names in ascending order by regional id. Refer to the region by name. (This will involve joining the tables).
  ![join](10-join)

  SQL Query:
