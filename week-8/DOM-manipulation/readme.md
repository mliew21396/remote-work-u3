#DOM Manipulation Challenge

##Learning Competencies
- execute Javascript functions that change the appearance of the DOM
- Explain the DOM API and why it is important to web developers
- Use HTML5 tags to simplify code

## Summary

This challenge is all about the Document Object Model (DOM). Mozilla developer network has a great resource on understanding the definitions of the DOM and why it is important [MDN DOM guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/API/DOM). You can manipulate the HTML elements on the page, the browser history, create animations, and utilize the full screen of the computer all using Javascript. You can imagine that this is a very useful tool for any web developer to have!

Fun trick, open up your dev tools console in one of your tabs and enter this command to go back in your history without using any buttons or keyboard shortcuts!

`window.history.go(-1)` To go further back use a smaller negative number (-2, -3 , etc.).

In this exercise, we will be getting our feet wet with DOM manipulation using ECMAscript 5. No imported libraries such as jquery will be used in this exercise.

You will find all of the methods you need in this resource [MDN document docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/document). Particularly the getElementByClassName, getElementById. Also, here is a great cheat sheet by Over-API [Over-API DOM Reference](http://overapi.com/html-dom/).

## Release 0:

Add the class "done" to the div.release_1.

## Release 1:

Set the display property of div.release_2 to none.

## Release 2:

Change the inner text of the <h1> tag to "I completed release 3."

## Release 3:

Add the background color #b163a3 to the div.release_4. #b163a3 was Pantone's color of the year 2014!

## Release 4:

Select all occurances of class .release_4 and change the text-size to 2em.

## Release 5:

Take the HTML in the template.hidden and append it to the bottom of the page. Here is a resource for using the template tag. [Treehouse Blog Template Tag](http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/creating-reusable-markup-with-the-html-template-element).


## Release 6: [Reflect](https://github.com/Devbootcamp/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/coding-references/reflection-guidelines.md)

Add a reflection to talk about what you learned about DOM Manipulation. Try to limit yourself to 10-15 minutes of reflection time.
