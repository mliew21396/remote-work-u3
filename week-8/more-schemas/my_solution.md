## Release 4: Reflect
<!-- This was a pretty fun challenge. I didn't know sql tables were organized in these three patterns. I know I'm going to need more practice to know which is the best schema to use right off the bat. I'm still trying to familiarize the pros and cons of each so I can recognize the correct schema quickly. I look forward to diving deeper into relational databases. -->
