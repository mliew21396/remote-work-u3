# U3.W7: SQLZoo for SQL Queries

## Learning Competencies
- Write simple SELECT statements to extract data from one or more fields on a single table using the SELECT, FROM, WHERE, LIMIT, and ORDER BY keywords


## Summary
In this challenge, you will dive in to SQL - Structured Query Language for databases. SQL is a language that allows you to retrieve data from a relational database. It is a programming language in its own right, so the goal here will be to learn how to use some of the syntax and get used to it's basics. You'll be using SQLzoo for this.

## Release 0: Go to [SQLzoo](http://sqlzoo.net/wiki/Main_Page)
Start the first set of exercises "SELECT basics".  Complete this set and complete the quiz that is linked to at the bottom. **DO NOT CREATE AN ACCOUNT - There is an annoying bug in SQLZoo that gives users issues when they try.**


## Release 1:  Complete the following sections along with their quizzes:

* 2 SELECT from World
* 3 SELECT from Nobel (the quiz for this section is not mandatory)
* 5 SUM and COUNT
* 6 JOIN (#8-13 of the tutorial is **BONUS**!)

You will need to do some research as you go. The tutorial is more meant to get you to experiment and try queries. It's not really intended to teach. So this is a good time to amp up your researching skills! [w3schools.com](http://www.w3schools.com/sql/default.asp) is a pretty good reference.

When you finish each required quiz, take a screenshot of it. You'll need to include it in your solution file.

## Release 3: Save your Quiz Results
When you are finished, rename your Screen shots to correspond to the different quizzes and save them in the [imgs](../imgs) directory in this repository. THEN, add the images inline into your [my_quizzes.md](my_quizzes.md) file in this directory using markdown.

## Release 4: [Reflect](https://github.com/Devbootcamp/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/coding-references/reflection-guidelines.md) in the reflection section of your [my_quizzes.md](my_quizzes.md) file.

## Release 5: Go beyond (Optional)
Dive into the other sections!  Follow the tutorials and take the quizzes to deepen your SQL skills.
