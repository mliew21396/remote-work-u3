Go to [Learn SQL the Hard Way](http://sql.learncodethehardway.org/book/). This is a work-in-progress by the author. He may miss a few steps that you'll want to google as you go. Use the [4-Intro to SQLite](4-intro-to-SQLite) challenge to help you through as well.

Read the preface through Chapter 13.

For each chapter, complete the exercises.

When you finish each chapter, copy your work into [exercises.sql](exercises.sql). You can simply copy and paste from the terminal.
