#U3.W9: Make your Blog Professional

## Learning Competencies
- Evaluate a website in terms of design and user experience
- Use HTML tags to place content on a website
- Manipulate HTML elements using CSS

## Summary
You've been blogging over 8 weeks now, and you have a lot of great material! Now's your chance to edit your work and make your site more professional before you get on site.

Don't forget to continue contributing to your blog when you are on site as well. Blogging won't be mandatory, but it will certainly be useful for solidifying concepts.

## Releases

## Release 0: Revisit your github.io site
What is your impression of the site? What do you think of the experience when compared to other websites you like? Consider what you would like to change now and compare that with your plan for maintenance you created in week 2. You can also decide to completely rework your CSS and HTML based on the maintenance/improvement plan or your new ideas.

## Release 1: Modify your site
You can choose to implement [Jekyll](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages/), Bootstrap, etc. on your github.io site or you can modify your HTML and CSS without using a framework. Make the site look great and refresh your HTML/CSS skills. Frameworks can be a bit of a pain to set up and get running, so be prepared for that if you choose to go that route. You can also take this time to rewrite or edit any of your earlier posts.

Use best practices for time management! As you've already learned, it's easy to go down rabbit holes when you are working on your site.

## Release 2: Get Reviews
Send your revised site to at least two people you trust to get feedback.

## Release 3: Integrate the feedback
Take the feedback you like and implement it. Did it improve your site?

## Release 4: Deploy to a personal URL (Optional)
Look up how to deploy your github.io site to your own personal domain.

## Release 5: Reflect on your process
Write a new blog post about this experience of working on your own personal website. What have you liked, what has been challenging?

## Release 6: Review
Go to previous twitter hashtags and browse some sites.
