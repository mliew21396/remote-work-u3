#U3.W9: Make your Blog Professional Grade!

## Learning Competencies
- Evaluate a website in terms of design and user experience
- Use HTML tags to place content on a website
- Manipulate HTML elements using CSS

## Summary:
You've been blogging over 8 weeks now, and you have a lot of great material! Now's your chance to edit your work and make your site professional before you get into DBC. You want this to be (more) ready for employers when you graduate!

Don't forget to continue contributing to your blog when you are on site as well. Blogging won't be mandatory, but it will certainly be useful.

## Release 0: Revisit your github.io site
What is your impression of the site? What do you think of the experience when compared to other websites you like? Jot some notes on what you would like to change. You can also decide to completely rework your CSS and HTML.

## Release 1: Wireframe/Modify your site
You can either choose to implement [Jekyll](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages/) on your github.io page or you can write all of your HTML and CSS again. Make it look awesome!

You can also take this time to rewrite or edit any of your earlier posts!

## Release 2: Get Reviews
Send your site to some people you trust. What are their impressions? Would they want to continue reading your blog?

## Release 3: Integrate the feedback
Take the feedback you like and implement it. Did it improve your site?

## Release 4: Deploy to a personal URL (Optional)
Look up how to deploy your github.io site to your own personal domain.

## Release 5: Reflect on your process
Write a new blog post about this experience of blogging to learn and reflect (as well as the process of this challenge).

## Release 6: Review
Go to previous twitter hashtags and browse some sites. (Or you can use [this feed](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23DBCDesign%20OR%20%23DBCCSS%20OR%20%23DBCJavaScript%20OR%20%23DBCRuby%20OR%20%23DBCClass%20OR%20%23DBCConcepts%20OR%20%23DBCSQL%20OR%20%23DBCTeaching%20OR%20%23DBCTech%20OR%20%23DBCFireside%20OR%20%23DBCTechProbs%20OR%20%23DBCThinkStyle%20OR%20%23DBCPerfectQs%20OR%20%23DBCConflict%20OR%20%23DBCValue%20OR%20%23DBCStereotypeThreat%20OR%20%23DBCPairing%20OR%20%23DBCmysite%20OR%20%23DBCtwitter%20OR%20%23DBCU2W4%20OR%20DBCweek1&src=typd) to see all the current tweets) What do you like about the personal web sites? Do you have any feedback? Leave them some feedback as an issue (or comment on their post)!
