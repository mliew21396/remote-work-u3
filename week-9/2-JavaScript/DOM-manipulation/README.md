#U3.W9: DOM Manipulation Challenge

## Learning Competencies
- Modify the appearance of the DOM using JavaScript
- Explain the DOM API and its importance to web developers
- Use HTML5 tags to make code more readable

## Summary

This challenge is about the Document Object Model (DOM) and JavaScript. You can manipulate the HTML elements on the DOM, view the browser history, create animations, and utilize the full screen of the computer all using JavaScript. As you can imagine, these are useful tricks for web developers!

To view the history of a site, open up the Chrome Dev Tools console in any website and enter `window.history.go(-1)` to go back in your history without using any buttons or keyboard shortcuts! To go further back use a smaller negative number ex. (-2, -3).

In this challenge, you will learn a bit about DOM manipulation using ECMAscript 5. No imported libraries such as jQuery will be used.

Please read the [MDN DOM guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/API/DOM) for getting a good definition of the DOM and why it is important.

You will find all of the methods you need in this resource [MDN document docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/document). Focus on the `getElementByClassName` and `getElementById` methods. You can also view this great [cheat sheet](http://overapi.com/html-dom/) by Over-API.
