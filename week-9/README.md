# Review

Week 9 Curriculum will be released next Friday.

<!-- You've learned a lot of diverse material in Phase 0, and now you are only one week away from Phase 1. We hope you're excited! This week's work-load is a little lighter, which will hopefully give you some breathing room for moving and resting up before Phase 1 starts.

## Challenges

The challenges this week can be done in any order.
1. [Professional Blog](professional_blog.md)
2. [JavaScript Challenges](2-JavaScript) *select 2*
3. [Ruby Challenges](1-HTML-CSS) *select 2*
4. [Cultural Blog](6-cultural-blog.md)
5. [Cohort Bonding](7-cohort-bonding.md)
6. [BONUS Challenges](BONUS-challenges) *Optional*

If this week is too light for you, complete all of the challenges and review any BONUS challenges you missed from previous weeks. Read the Well-Grounded Rubyist or re-read POODR.

This week you'll want to request feedback on Twitter using the hashtag **#DBCU3W9.**

## Submitting your work
- You must complete the [week's submission form](http://apply.devbootcamp.com) to turn in your work by Sunday at 11:59pm.
