## Summary
It's time to check in with your accountability groups and share your solutions!

## Releases

## Release 0: Identify Concepts
Using the means your group decided to use for communication (email, hangout, etc), identify one or two of the concepts or challenges you struggled with this week, and explain what the difficulties were. When you need help, ask for it.

## Release 1: Share your solution
Select one of your solutions to a challenge to share with your accountability group members. You can choose one you are most proud of, one that challenged you, one you just couldn't get, etc.

Feel free to share a previous week's solo challenge as well (now that the week is over).

## Release 2: Review solutions
Review the solutions your accountability group sent to you. Practice reading their solutions. See if you understand what is going on. If you don't, try to determine what it is that's confusing, is it related to your knowledge of the code or the way the code is written? Do you have any suggestions for methods or ways to improve the code?

Remember to keep your feedback specific, kind, and actionable!

## Release 3: Respond and Discuss
Respond to your cohort mates on what concepts confused them and see if you can help. Also be sure to send your feedback (either via issues or email) for your accountability group members' solutions.

## Release 4: Lack of Engagement
If there is a member of your group who does not engage, please email <phase0@devbootcamp.com> to let us know. We will follow up with the person or provide you with additional information.
