#U3.W9: Grocery List in JavaScript

## Learning Competencies
- Define functions in JavaScript
- Define local variables in JavaScript
- Create, add elements to, access, and iterate over arrays in JavaScript
- Create, add properties to, delete properties from, and access values from JavaScript Object literals

## Summary:
Remember your grocery list GPS challenge? Now you will want to re-implement your solution in JavaScript.

You can keep it as a terminal program, OR you can look into creating an HTML version using pure JavaScript. It's up to you how complicated you want to make this. Try using [JSFiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/) to see all of your code interact. Or you could create your own HTML, CSS, and JS files in this directory and run them in the browser.

## Releases

## Release 0: User Stories
Revisit your user stories from the GPS challenge. Do you want to modify any of the stories for this challenge?

## Release 1: [Pseudocode](https://github.com/Devbootcamp/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/coding-references/pseudocode.md)
What needs to change in your pseudocode to use JavaScript? Try to re-write your pseudocode completely thinking from a JavaScript perspective (as opposed to Ruby).
