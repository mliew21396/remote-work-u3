<!-- Add your reflection here -->
<!-- # This challenge took me 1 hours. -->
<!-- This was a fun challenge. I've dabbled with DOM manipulation in the last solo challenge so this wasn't too new for me. What was new was the template element in html. I'm curious on more use cases for this element. Couldn't this just all be in JS instead of writing a template in HTML? I'll research this topic more. I'm intrigued. -->
