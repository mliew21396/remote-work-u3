# U3.W9: Asking Good Questions

## Learning Competencies
- Formulate good questions that help you get answers you need

## Release 0: New file

In your [USERNAME].github.io/blog directory, copy your blog template into a new HTML file named `c9-questions.html`.

## Release 1: Research asking good questions
Have you ever posted on the Google+ community (or elsewhere) and didn't get the answer you needed? Were you frustrated by not receiving a response? Did you review the question and consider why people weren't answering? Did you not give enough information? Was the question asked elsewhere? Was the question unclear? Learning how to ask good questions is a necessary skill for success as a developer (especially at DBC). So take a bit of time to research how to ask good questions.

Here are a couple resource suggestions:

-[How do I ask a good question?](http://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask)
-[Writing the Perfect Question](http://web.archive.org/web/20140709094611/http://msmvps.com/blogs/jon_skeet/archive/2010/08/29/writing-the-perfect-question.aspx) *The blog post has been removed so we are using the internet archive to get the information*

You may also want to research on asking good questions in person. Use the power of Google.

## Release 2: Blog
Analyze some of the questions you've asked (either the community, a friend, or yourself). Were these good questions? What was good/not so good about them? How could you make them better so you are more likely to get an answer.

If you can't think of your own questions, go to the Google+ community or stack overflow and analyze the questions that are there. What characteristics make up a good question? What were the characteristics of the questions that did not get answered?

Make sure you keep these in mind for DBC! We are huge fans of students asking questions, but you'll need to ask good questions so you can get the answers that will help you. You should also feel free to ask for clarification and to push if you don't understand the answers you get.

## Release 3: Publish
Link to your blog on the blog/index.html of your site and push your changes.

Make sure the index of your site is maintained, nice, and professional. This is your face in the online community, so make it nice!

## Release 4: Promote

Show off your work and share your knowledge with your cohort-mates using Twitter!

Tweet your blog post using **#DBCPerfectQs**.

## Release 5: Read

Read at least one post another by student. Give the author A.S.K (actionable, specific, and kind) feedback as an issue on their repo or a tweet!
