# U3.W7: Eloquent JavaScript

## Learning Competencies
- Compare Ruby and JavaScript Syntax
- Define local variables in JavaScript
- Create objects of different types in JavaScript

## Summary
[*Eloquent Javascript*](http://eloquentjavascript.net/) is a book that comes highly recommended, so we're asking you to read through it and answer some questions before starting the next challenges.


For the sections in [javascript_notes.md](javascript_notes.md) that ask you to solve a problem using JavaScript, write the code in [my_solutions.js](my_solutions.js) and run it in node unless prompted to do otherwise.

If you prefer a more active style of learning, you can also use [codecademy's JavaScript track](http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/javascript) to supplement and get practice, but make sure to still answer the questions in [javascript_notes.md](javascript_notes.md).

## Releases:

## Release 0: [Introduction](http://eloquentjavascript.net/00_intro.html)

Answer the questions in the [javascript_notes.md](javascript_notes.md) file.

## Release 1: [Ch. 1: Values, Types, and Operators](http://eloquentjavascript.net/01_values.html)

Remember to answer the questions in the [javascript_notes.md](javascript_notes.md) file.

Read the chapter summary.

Now you should be ready to face the next challenges!

If you want to continue reading this book, we have no problem with that. You can even work through the exercises, but this is the end of what you will need for this week. Work to get a basic understanding of JavaScript fundamentals before you dive deeper.
