U3.W7: Eloquent JavaScript

I worked on this challenge [by myself, with:]

You should complete any coding sections in the [my_solution.js](my_solution.js) file unless prompted to do so here. You can run the file using node. Similar to Ruby simply go to your terminal and type `node file_name.js`.

## Release 0: Introduction

- Did you learn anything new about JavaScript or programming in general?

- What do you still feel uncomfortable with?

## Release 1: Chapter 1: Values, Types, and Operators

- Identify 2 similarities and 2 differences between JavaScript and Ruby syntax with regard to numbers, arithmetic, strings, booleans, and various operators you noticed.

## Release 2: Chapter 2: Program Structure

- What is an expression?

- What is the purpose of semicolons in JavaScript? Are they always required?

- What is the cause of a variable returning "undefined?"

- Write your own variable and do something to it in the [my_solution.js](my_solution.js) file.

- What does console.log do and when would you use it? What Ruby method is this similar to?

- Write a program that asks for a user to input their favorite food. After they hit return have the program say: "Hey! That's my favorite too!"

**Use the browser console (in Dev Tools) to do this one. Node does not support the `prompt` or `alert` function. Paste your solution in the box below.**

```javascript

// Your program here

```

- Describe `while` and `for` loops

- Did you notice any other similarities or differences between Ruby and JavaScript in this section?

- Complete at least one of the exercises (Looping a Triangle, FizzBuzz, or Chess Board) in the [my_solution.js](my_solution.js) file.


## Release 3: Functions

- Compare local and global variables

- When should you use functions?

- What is a function declaration?

- Complete the `minimum` exercise in the [my_solution.js](my_solution.js) file.

## Release 4: Data Structures: Objects and Arrays

- What is the difference between using a dot and bracket to look up a property? Ex. array.max vs. array[max]

- Create an object called "me" that stores your name, age, 3 favorite foods, and a quirk in your [my_solution.js](my_solution.js) file.


- What is a JavaScript object with a name and value property similar to in Ruby?

```

## Release 6: Reflection
Write your reflection here.
