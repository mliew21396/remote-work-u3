# Introduction to JavaScript

<!-- Please do not start week 7. We will release it with changes at least by the Friday before the week begins. -->

JavaScript is known as the "language of the web." It is a powerful object-oriented language that is light-weight and can communicate with the browser. This week, you will be introduced to basic JavaScript syntax like variables and functions. JavaScript will be treated as a language in its own right and the challenges will be very similar to the Ruby challenges you have been working on.

This week focuses on the basics of the JavaScript language. You will have more advanced JavaScript challenges and more opportunities to use JavaScript to manipulate the DOM in weeks 8 and 9.

**You have an asynchronous group challenge this week. Take a look at it early so you don't get blind-sided.**

This week you'll want to request feedback on Twitter using the hashtag **#DBCU3W7.** Only other DBC students can actually see your repositories because they are private.

## Submitting your work
- You must complete the [week's submission form](http://apply.devbootcamp.com) to turn in your work.
- The week's work is due each Sunday by 11:59pm.

**If you do not finish by the deadline:**
- Complete the week 7 extension request. (You only get to apply for an extension for week 7 in Unit 3).
