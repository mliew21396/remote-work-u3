# Week 7: Introduction to JavaScript

JavaScript is known as the "language of the web." It is a powerful object-oriented language that is light-weight and can communicate with the browser. This week, you will be introduced to basic JavaScript syntax like variables and functions. JavaScript will be treated as a language in its own right and the challenges will be very similar to the Ruby challenges you have been working on.

This week focuses on the basics of the JavaScript language. You will have more advanced JavaScript challenges and more opportunities to use JavaScript to manipulate the DOM in weeks 8 and 9. We give you a book resource to go through. If you would like to supplement the book with [Codecademy's JavaScript track](http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/javascript), you should feel free to do that.

**You have an asynchronous group challenge this week. Take a look at it early so you don't get blind-sided.**
