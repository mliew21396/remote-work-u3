#U3.W7: Separate Numbers with Commas in JavaScript **Mandatory Pairing Challenge**

## Learning Competencies
- Define local variables in JavaScript
- Create, add elements to, access, and iterate over arrays in JavaScript
- Create, add properties to, delete properties from, and access values in object literals

## Summary:
In week 4, you completed a solo challenge to separate numbers with commas. In this challenge, you will get a chance to pair on this challenge using JavaScript.

Create a function `separateComma`. It should accept an integer as an argument and return a comma-separated integer as a string.

We recommend thinking through the logic with your pair **without** looking at your old pseudocode or solution. Try to get your brain thinking about the problem in a fresh, new way. Also, do not use Regular Expressions to complete this challenge. Regular Expressions look for patterns and are recognizable because they will be shown between two slashes, like so: `/\d/`. (You saw some examples of regular expressions in the cipher challenge).

For example:

```javascript

separateComma(1569743) == "1,569,743"

```

## Releases:

## Release 0: Pseudocode
With your pair, use your knowledge of the problem (and JavaScript) to pseudocode. You'll need to break this down into the smallest of steps since JavaScript doesn't have as many nice built-in methods as Ruby.

## Release 1: [Initial Solution](https://github.com/Devbootcamp/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/coding-references/initial-solution.md)
With your pair, write your initial solution based on the pseudocode you wrote.

## Release 2: Create Tests (OPTIONAL)
In the last two challenges, you saw assert statements that created tests. Review these tests and adapt them to test your code for this challenge. This is optional.

## Release 3: [Refactor](https://github.com/Devbootcamp/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/coding-references/refactoring.md)
With your pair, refactor your initial solution. Evaluate the variable names and spend some time with [JavaScript Documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) to see if you can incorporate any built-ins.

## Release 4: [Reflect](https://github.com/Devbootcamp/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/coding-references/reflection-guidelines.md)

## Release 5: Commit and Push your changes

## Release 6: [Review other's solutions](https://github.com/Devbootcamp/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/coding-references/review.md) **(Mandatory)**
Leave an issue telling the student what they did well and can do better next time. Be kind, specific and actionable. You are expected to leave at least two issues to different people for this challenge.
