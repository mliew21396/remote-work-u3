 // U3.W7: Code Combat Challenge

// I worked on this challenge [by myself, with:]



// Release 1: Consider the syntax
// What are you doing in each of these missions?



// Release 2: Analyze the syntax
// Can you break down each command to determine what it's doing? Select two to break down.


// Release 3: Answer the following questions:
//   - What is `self` referring to? Think programming-wise rather than in the terms of the game.
//   - What does the `()` do in JavaScript?
//   - What is the point of the semicolons?


// Release 4: Reflect
// Do you think the game succeeds at its mission to teach JavaScript?
// What does it do well? What does it not do well?
// Were you able to use your Ruby knowledge to break down two
// of the commands effectively?

// Write your reflection here.
