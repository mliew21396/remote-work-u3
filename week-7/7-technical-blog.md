# U3.W7: Technical Blog

## Learning Competencies
- Explain how JavaScript and Ruby differ

## Summary
You've spent four weeks learning Ruby and getting to know its powerful built-in methods. How was your experience learning JavaScript?

## Release 0: Create your file
In your [USERNAME].github.io/blog directory, copy your blog template into a new HTML file named `t6-JavaScript.html`.

## Release 1: Compare
Identify one fundamental difference between how Ruby and JavaScript do something, and teach your audience about it. There are many ways you can look at this. Here are some ideas:

- Ruby Hashes vs. JavaScript Objects
- Ruby classes vs. JavaScript constructor functions
- Ruby documentation vs. JavaScript documentation
- Looping in Ruby vs. Looping in JavaScript

I'm sure you can think of many more examples.

## Release 2: Blog
Write a blog (or create a video to present on your blog) where you teach your audience the difference you identified between JavaScript and Ruby.

## Release 3: Publish
Link to your blog on the blog/index.html of your site and push your changes.

## Release 4: Promote
Share what you've learned with your cohort mates using Twitter!

Tweet your blog post using **#DBCJavaScript**.

## Release 5: Read
Read at least one post another student wrote. Give the author A.S.K (Actionable, Specific, and Kind) feedback as an issue on their repository or a tweet!
