It's time to check in with your accountability groups again!

## Releases:
## Release 0: Identify Concepts

Using the means your group decided to use for communication, explain the concepts that confused you and ask your accountability group members for help.

The other members of your group will have similar questions or can explain the parts that were confusing. Interact with one another and try to help each other out as much as possible.
