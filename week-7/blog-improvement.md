# U3.W7: Blog Improvement - Add Projects

## Learning Competencies
- Use HTML tags to present content on a website
- Format HTML elements using the CSS padding, borders, and margin properties
- Use CSS to add and format colors, fonts, icons, images, etc.

## Summary:
It's important to maintain your HTML and CSS skills, so we've integrated mini-challenges so you can continually practice and add to your website each week.

In this challenge, you will be adding a place for your projects to live on your website. If you did the bonus challenge in week 7, you'll want to add that to this directory.

## Releases:

## Release 0: New Directory
In this week (solo challenge) and the upcoming weeks, you will have some assignments you will want to add to your website so others can view them. First, in your [USERNAME].github.io repository, you'll want to make a new directory called "projects".

## Release 1: New Index Page
In your projects directory, add an "index.html" page. Consider how you will want to present your projects to your viewers, and create an index page based around that. You may want to create a wireframe before adding any HTML. (If you don't have any projects to add at the moment, you may want to create sample links).

## Release 2: Apply CSS
Once you've added the content to your page, View it in the browser. How is your existing CSS formatting your page? Make modifications as necessary to improve the look of the page. You can go back and modify the HTML as necessary, just make sure you are relying on CSS to format the page.

## Release 3: Add a Link
Now that you have the projects directory, make sure people can find it from the home page!

## Release 4: Update your site
In a previous week, you created a maintenance schedule for your site. Now is your time to work on those planned changes you wanted to create this week.

## Release 5: Commit, Push, and create a Pull Request!
Now that you've made all of your changes, commit them, and create a pull request to your repository. Merge your pull request to make it part of your site!

If you want to ask for feedback, please post on Twitter using the **#DBCU3W7** hashtag.

## Release 6: [Review](https://github.com/Devbootcamp/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/coding-references/review.md) (Optional, but Highly encouraged).
