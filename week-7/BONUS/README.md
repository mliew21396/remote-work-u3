# U3.W7: Extra Study Ideas (Optional)

- [Javascript Olympics Challenge](javascript-olympics)

- Go through Codecademy's [JavaScript Track](http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/javascript)

- Research adding JavaScript to Websites and incorporate some of what you learned into your blog. There is a lot of information out there on how to do this. You may find this chapter on [Web Building - Adding Code (JavaScript)](http://www.w3schools.com/website/web_spa_javascript.asp) from w3schools.com useful.

- Try working with nested arrays and objects in JavaScript to track data. See if you can access, modify, combine that data. Here are some ideas:

  - Define your favorite characters (as objects) from books, TV Shows/Movies, video games, etc. Give them a number of properties, and add some objects as properties as well. Add each object to an array. Then see if you can access objects based on certain factors, like names that begin with the same letter, from the same genre, etc.
  - Create a register (like a checkbook register) where you can keep track of your spending. Add properties to define categories, dates, amounts, where you spent the money etc. Try to compute your spending in certain categories over time. See how much you spent at a particular store.
  - Create your own way to practice this.

- If you are really into the idea of games as a way to teach JS, get into [Code Combat](http://codecombat.com/). The further in you go, the more advanced the concepts are. If you are a gamer, you may enjoy this.
